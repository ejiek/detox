De Tox is a theme for [Zola] static site generator.
It's based on CSS only framework [Bulma].

It seems to be a great pair.
Zola is a single binary without dependencies and Bulma is free from JavaScript.
Both are blazing fast, flexible and are easy to use.
To top it off Bulma is written in [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) which is [well supported](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/sass/) by [Zola]
